Frink III 		## Contact: frink@southernconnections.net		## Usage	        ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating	        ## the location of the CSV files to process. 		## Internally a "/" is appended to the directory name		## when the filenames are created from the number or sequence of numbers		## in "id"		## id is the number or sequence of numbers indicating the names of .csv files to process.	        ## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating	        ## the name of the pollutant for which this function calculates 	        ## the mean. It must be either "sulfate" or "nitrate." Not both.	        ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID number	        ## or numbers to be used. 		## Value returned	        ## The function returns the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list	        ## in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values).			if (file.exists(directory) == FALSE) 		    stop("Your directory path is not valid.") # That directory is required by the specifications			fileName <- paste( directory, "/", sprintf("%03d", id[1]),".csv", sep = "" )		tempTbl <- read.csv(fileName,  sep = ",", quote = "\"",header = TRUE, dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "#")		bigTbl <- (tempTbl[[pollutant]])		len <- length(id) 		if(len >= 2) { # if there was only one file specified, no more processing.
